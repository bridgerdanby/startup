#### A few notes on things that I have learned
* Be careful when creating a repository or I will end up with a phantom branch
* Use git bash instead of bash on cmd prompt
* chmod 400 <key> is the correct permission for the key
* seems like there is a lot of code duplication in html, is there a solution to this?
* careful with HTML bugs, if the CSS isnt showing up it could be because of an HTML typo
* a google search with bootstrap ___ styles usually finds good examples of bootstrap tools
* develop HTML and CSS in parallel when possible
* build a js file for each page so it isnt as complex and can be tested incrementally
* dont overcomplicate things, js isnt meant for super complex things and I dont have the time anyways
* js has multiple ways to do things
* log is a great tool to fix silent bugs

#### server to do list
* games are currently on local storage, move them to server so they are more persistant (will be in database later)
* add other basic js things like simon has
* add a way to add games - simple webpage
* objects can be added straight into mongodb
  
##### use mongo connection string from node 2.2.12 for it to work

##### other notes
* Domain names - An A record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A CNAME record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map byu.com to the same IP address as byu.edu so that either one could be used.
* Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements. Here is a short list of HTML elements that you will commonly see.

CSS inside to out
  * content, padding, border, margin
  
objects:
* { key: value }
* can specify functions log: log() {...}
* constructor is a function that returns a object
  function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
  
class
* explicit constructor
* no need for function label 
* # makes it private
* class Employee extends Person
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
  
Rest:
But JavaScript provides the rest syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the rest of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a rest parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then you can call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
  
Spread:
  Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
  
Destructuring:
  const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
  
  const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
  
await - block until promise is fullfilled
async - must be defined at top level, makes it work with await
  
script things:
  * chmod +x deploy.sh make a script executable
  * ls -la deploy.sh list all elements, even hidden ones in log format

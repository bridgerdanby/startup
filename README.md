# The best startup yet!!??

### Pitch
<p> Imagine you are comming home from work after a day at work. You are tired but have been looking forward to spending sacred time with your kids. You have a few things to do around the house before you are free to spend time with them. You finish and finally have an hour to spend with them. You realize that in all your efforts to make time to spend with your family you forgot to plan anything. That is where my product comes it.

#### A few notes on things that I have learned
* Be careful when creating a repository or I will end up with a phantom branch
* Use git bash instead of bash on cmd prompt
* chmod 400 <key> is the correct permission for the key
* seems like there is a lot of code duplication in html, is there a solution to this?
* careful with HTML bugs, if the CSS isnt showing up it could be because of an HTML typo
* a google search with bootstrap ___ styles usually finds good examples of bootstrap tools
* develop HTML and CSS in parallel when possible

<p>http codes:</p>
<p>100-info 200-ok, 300-redirects or cacheing 400-client 500-server</p>
<p>http headers - standard content-type, host, cookie, NOT LANGUAGE</p>
<p>cookies - server store data on client</p>
<p>requests - top to bottom, use is called first ????</p>
<p>websocket - peer to peer</p>
<p>jsx - inject html into js, componentize html, composabilty of html NOT CSS</p>
<p>npm install - locks version, adds source code, dependancies to package.json</p>
<p>fetch - anywhere</p>
<p>daemons - independant of user, starts when rebooted, pm2, cannot fork</p>

# The best startup yet!!??

notes: the websocket sends to everyone but itself. For the future it would need to clean out the authtokens so you have to log back in. mongo has a session expiration.

#### react things:
<p>it is a single page so the header and footer and constant while the middle is swapped out. (like android fragments in one main activity). Refactor by creating a function that returns the html. JS needs to be embedded. Use states where necessary</P>

### Pitch
<p> Imagine you are comming home from work after a day at work. You are tired but have been looking forward to spending sacred time with your kids.

#### A few notes on things that I have learned
* Be careful when creating a repository or I will end up with a phantom branch
* Use git bash instead of bash on cmd prompt
* chmod 400 <key> is the correct permission for the key
* seems like there is a lot of code duplication in html, is there a solution to this?
* careful with HTML bugs, if the CSS isnt showing up it could be because of an HTML typo
* a google search with bootstrap ___ styles usually finds good examples of bootstrap tools
* develop HTML and CSS in parallel when possible
* build a js file for each page so it isnt as complex and can be tested incrementally
* dont overcomplicate things, js isnt meant for super complex things and I dont have the time anyways
* js has multiple ways to do things
* log is a great tool to fix silent bugs

#### server to do list
* games are currently on local storage, move them to server so they are more persistant (will be in database later)
* add other basic js things like simon has
* add a way to add games - simple webpage
* objects can be added straight into mongodb
  
##### use mongo connection string from node 2.2.12 for it to work
##### websocket - notification when a new game is added by a user
##### required installs ws mongodb express cookie-parser uuid bcrypt

##### other notes
* Domain names - An A record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A CNAME record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map byu.com to the same IP address as byu.edu so that either one could be used.
* Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements. Here is a short list of HTML elements that you will commonly see.

objects:
* { key: value }
* can specify functions log: log() {...}
* constructor is a function that returns a object
  function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich

* no need for function label 
* # makes it private

    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
  
Rest:
But JavaScript provides the rest syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the rest of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a rest parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then you can call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
  
Spread:
  Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
  
Destructuring:
  const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
  
  const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
  
await - block until promise is fullfilled
async - must be defined at top level, makes it work with await
  
script things:
  * chmod +x deploy.sh make a script executable
  * ls -la deploy.sh list all elements, even hidden ones in log format
  
httpOnly tells the browser to not allow JavaScript running on the browser to read the cookie.
secure requires HTTPS to be used when sending the cookie back to the server.
sameSite will only return the cookie to the domain that generated it.
  
  
  # Security overview

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**:

- [Database of publicized software vulnerabilities](https://cve.mitre.org/)
- [SQL Injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)

The internet allows us to socially connect, conduct financial transactions, and provide access to sensitive individual, corporate, and government data. It is also accessible from every corner of the planet. This positions the internet as a tool that can make the world a much better place, but it also makes a very attractive target for those who would seek to do harm. Preventing that potential for harm needs to be in the forefront of you mind whenever you create or use a web application.

You can see bad actors at work on your very own server by using `ssh` to open a console to your server and reviewing the authorization log. The authorization log captures all of the attempts to create a session on your server.

```sh
sudo less +G /var/log/auth.log
```

The last entry in the log will be from your connection to the server.

```sh
Feb 23 16:26:54 sshd[319071]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user ubuntu(uid=1000) by (uid=0)
Feb 23 16:26:54 systemd-logind[480]: New session 1350 of user ubuntu.
Feb 23 16:26:54 systemd: pam_unix(systemd-user:session): session opened for user ubuntu(uid=1000) by (uid=0)
```

However, you will see lots of other attempts with specific user names associated with common exploits. These all should be failing to connect, but if your server is not configured properly then an unauthorized access is possible. The sample of attempts below show the IP addresses of the attacker, as well as the user name that they used. Using the `whois` utility we can see that these attacks are originating from servers at DLive.kr in Korea, and DigitalOcean.com in the USA.

```sh
Feb 19 02:34:28 sshd[298185]: Invalid user developer from 27.1.253.142
Feb 19 02:37:12 sshd[298193]: Invalid user minecraft1 from 27.1.253.142
Feb 23 14:26:19 sshd[318868]: Invalid user siteadmin 174.138.72.191
Feb 23 14:22:18 sshd[318845]: Invalid user tester 174.138.72.191
```

As an experiment, one of our TAs created a test server with a user named `admin` with password `password`. Within 15 minutes, an attacker had logged in, bypassed all the restrictions that were in place, and started using the server to attack other servers on the internet.

Even if you don't think your application is valuable enough to require security, you need to consider that you might be creating a security problem for your users on other systems. For example, think about a simple game application where a user is required to provides a username and password in order to play the game. If the application's data is then compromised, then an attacker could use the password, used for the game application, to gain access to other websites where the user might have used the same password. For example, their social networking sites, work account, or financial institution.

## Security terminology

Web application security, sometimes called AppSec, is a subset of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on preventing security vulnerabilities within end-user applications. Web application security involves securing the frontend code running on the user's device and also the backend code running on the web server.

Here is a list of common phrases used by the security community that you should be familiar with.

- **Hacking** - The process of making a system do something it's not supposed to do.
- **Exploit** - Code or input that takes advantage of a programming or configuration flaw.
- **Attack Vector** - The method that a hacker employs to penetrate and exploit a system.
- **Attack Surface** - The exposed parts of a system that an attacker can access. For example, open ports (22, 443, 80), service endpoints, or user accounts.
- **Attack Payload** - The actual code, or data, that a hacker delivers to a system in order to exploit it.
- **Input sanitization** - "Cleaning" any input of potentially malicious data.
- **Black box testing** - Testing an application without knowledge of the internals of the application.
- **White box testing** - Testing an application by **with** knowledge of the source code and internal infrastructure.
- **Penetration Testing** - Attempting to gain access to, or exploit, a system in ways that are not anticipated by the developers.
- **Mitigation** - The action taken to remove, or reduce, a threat.

## Motivation for attackers

The following lists some common motivations at drives a system attack.

- **Disruption** - By overloading a system, encrypting essential data, or deleting critical infrastructure, an attacker can destroy normal business operations. This may be an attempt at extortion, or simply be an attempt to punish a business that that attacker does not agree with.
- **Data exfiltration** - By privately extracting, or publicly exposing, a system's data, an attacker can embarrass the company, exploit insider information, sell the information to competitors, or leverage the information for additional attacks.
- **Resource consumption** - By taking control of a company's computing resources an attacker can use it for other purposes such as mining cryptocurrency, gathering customer information, or attacking other systems.

## Examples of security failures

Security should always be a primary objective of any application. Building a web application that looks good and performs well, is a lot less important than building an application that is secure.

Here are a few examples where companies failed to properly prevent attacks to their systems.

- [$100 million dollars stolen through insider trading using SQL injection vulnerability](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/22/17716622/sec-business-wire-hack-stolen-press-release-fraud-ukraine)
- [Log4Shell remote code execution vulnerability, 93% of cloud vulnerable at time of discovery, dubbed "the most severe vulnerability ever"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell)
- [Russian hackers install backdoor on 18,000 government and Fortune 500 computers](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack)
- [Hackers Hold Computers of 23 Texas Towns For Ransom](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-08-20/hackers-hold-computers-of-23-texas-towns-for-ransom)

## Common hacking techniques

There are a few common exploitation techniques that you should be aware of. These include the following.

- **Injection**: When an application interacts with a database on the backend, a programmer will often take user input and concatenate it directly into a search query. This allows a hacker can use a specially crafted query to make the database reveal hidden information or even delete the database.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A category of attacks where an attacker can make malicious code execute on a different user's browser. If successful, an attacker can turn a website that a user trusts, into one that can steal passwords and hijack a user's account.

- **Denial of Service**: This includes any attack where the main goal is to render any service inaccessible. This can be done by deleting a database using an SQL injection, by sending unexpected data to a service endpoint that causes the program to crash, or by simply making more requests than a server can handle.

- **Credential Stuffing**: People have a tendency to reuse passwords or variations of passwords on different websites. If a hacker has a user's credentials from a previous website attack, then there is a good chance that they can successfully use those credentials on a different website. A hacker can also try to brute force attack a system by trying every possible combination of password.

- **Social engineering** - Appealing to a human's desire to help, in order to gain unauthorized access or information.

## What can I do about it?

Taking the time to learn the techniques a hacker uses to attack a system is the first step in preventing them from exploiting your systems. From there, develop a security mindset, where you always assume any attack surface will be used against you. Make security a consistent part of your application design and feature discussions. Here is a list of common security practices you should include in your applications.

- **Sanitize input data** - Always assume that any data you receive from outside your system will be used to exploit your system. Consider if the input data can be turned into an executable expression, or can overload computing, bandwidth, or storage resources.
- **Logging** - It is not possible to think of every way that your system can be exploited, but you can create an immutable log of requests that will expose when a system is being exploited. You can then trigger alerts, and periodically review the logs for unexpected activity.
- **Traps** - Create what appears to be valuable information and then trigger alarms when the data is accessed.
- **Educate** - Teach yourself, your users, and everyone you work with, to be security minded. Anyone who has access to your system should understand how to prevent physical, social, and software attacks.
- **Reduce attack surfaces** - Do not open access anymore than is necessary to properly provide your application. This includes what network ports are open, what account privileges are allowed, where you can access the system from, and what endpoints are available.
- **Layered security** - Do not assume that one safeguard is enough. Create multiple layers of security that each take different approaches. For example, secure your physical environment, secure your network, secure your server, secure your public network traffic, secure your private network traffic, encrypt your storage, separate your production systems from your development systems, put your payment information in a separate environment from your application environment. Do not allow data from one layer to move to other layers. For example, do not allow an employee to take data out of the production system.
- **Least required access policy** - Do not give any one user all the credentials necessary to control the entire system. Only give a user what access they need to do the work they are required to do.
- **Safeguard credentials** - Do not store credentials in accessible locations such as a public GitHub repository or a sticky note taped to a monitor. Automatically rotate credentials in order to limit the impact of an exposure. Only award credentials that are necessary to do a specific task.
- **Public review** - Do not rely on obscurity to keep your system safe. Assume instead that an attacker knows everything about your system and then make it difficult for anyone to exploit the system. If you can attack your system, then a hacker will be able to also. By soliciting public review and the work of external penetration testers, you will be able to discover and remove potential exploits.
